This document contains some information about what I had to do to get all the necessary 
dependencies working on my machine (Mac OSX + apollo HPC at Sussex)

Galfit:
I managed to get a precompiled version of Galfit and GalfitM for Mac.

PyProfit:
Pyprofit took a while but eventually it worked simply using pip. They are not concentrating
on the Python version so there are a few issues with scipy optimisation

MultiNest:
I followed the advice at http://astrobetter.com/wiki/MultiNest+Installation+Notes
I downloaded MultiNest from Johannes Buchner's GitHub. I had trouble with cmake but
just had to change the target for the compiler and re run cmake. 

After compiling multinest I had to export the target to the multinest executable to my PATH
